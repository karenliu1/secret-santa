# secret-santa

Coordinate and assign secret santas virtually by entering the same room.

## What's it for?

Ever wanted to organize a Secret Santa? Did you pick names out of a hat? Instead, you and your friends can now join a virtual room (just pick any word and have everyone join it) and shake a virtual hat, and each of you will see who your own secret gift recipient is.

Mostly, this was just a toy app to play around with React!

## How do I build it?

This app uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).

To build it, run:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

This will output an `index.js` which is referenced by `index.html`.

To have `index.js` constantly update whenever a source file is changed, run:
```
npm run watch
```
